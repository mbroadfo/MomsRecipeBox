fix: resolve recipe detail image display issues with direct S3 URLs

- Fix ImagePane component to use direct S3 URLs with proper region (us-west-2)
- Update S3 bucket name to correct mrb-recipe-images-dev bucket
- Implement smart extension fallback chain: .png → .jpg → .jpeg → .webp
- Handle existing S3 URLs missing region specification
- Update RecipeCard component for consistency with same S3 URL format
- Remove complex retry logic in favor of simple, reliable fallback mechanism

Resolves issue where recipe detail screens showed default images instead of actual recipe photos.
All recipe images now display correctly in both card view and detail view.

Technical changes:
- ImagePane.tsx: Updated URL conversion and fallback logic
- RecipeCard.tsx: Standardized S3 URL format with region
- Verified against S3 bucket mrb-recipe-images-dev in us-west-2
- Tested with recipes stored as .jpg files (Pressure Cooker Chilli, Summer Berry Trifle)

Impact: Recipe detail pages now show actual recipe photos instead of default placeholders.
