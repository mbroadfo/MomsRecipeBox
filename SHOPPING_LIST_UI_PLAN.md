# Shopping List UI Integration Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to integrate the backend shopping list functionality with the React frontend. The integration will provide users with the ability to add ingredients to their shopping list, view the list, mark items as purchased, and clear the list.

## Components to Create

### 1. Shopping List API Service

- Create new API functions in `src/utils/api.ts` for shopping list operations:
  - `getShoppingList(userId)`
  - `addToShoppingList(userId, items)`
  - `updateShoppingListItem(userId, itemId, checked)`
  - `deleteShoppingListItem(userId, itemId)`
  - `clearShoppingList(userId, action)`

### 2. Shopping List State Management

- Create a `useShoppingList` hook to manage shopping list state and operations
- Implement functions to add, update, delete items and clear list
- Provide loading/error states and data fetching

### 3. UI Components

- **ShoppingListPage.tsx**: Main shopping list view page
  - Display all shopping list items grouped by recipe
  - Allow checking/unchecking items
  - Allow deleting items
  - Provide buttons to clear all or mark all as checked
- **ShoppingListButton.tsx**: Component for the "Add to Shopping List" button in recipe view
- **ShoppingListIcon.tsx**: Navigation icon with optional badge showing count
- **ShoppingListItem.tsx**: Individual shopping list item with checkbox and delete button
- **EmptyShoppingList.tsx**: Placeholder when list is empty

### 4. Route and Navigation

- Add a route for the shopping list page in main router
- Add navigation link/icon in the header or menu

### 5. Recipe Detail Integration

- Enhance `IngredientsView.tsx` with checkboxes for each ingredient
- Add button to add selected ingredients to shopping list
- Implement local storage for persisting checked state between visits

## Implementation Steps

## Data Flow

1. **Adding Items**

3. **Updating Items**
   - When user checks/unchecks item, update sent to backend
   - UI updates optimistically
   - Error handling if update fails

4. **Deleting Items**
   - When user clicks delete, item removed from backend
   - UI updates optimistically
   - Error handling if delete fails

5. **Clearing List**
   - User clicks clear all or mark all as checked
   - Update sent to backend
   - UI updates based on action chosen

## Dependencies
