## üéØ Project Overview

**Goal**: Modernize CI/CD and deployment management from PowerShell-heavy approach to modern container-first, GitHub Actions-based workflow while maintaining all three deployment modes.

**Deployment Modes to Support**:
- üè† **Fully Local Mode**: `APP_MODE=express` + `MONGODB_MODE=local` + UI local
- üåê **Remote DB Mode**: `APP_MODE=express` + `MONGODB_MODE=atlas` + UI local  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Remote Backend Mode**: `APP_MODE=lambda` + `MONGODB_MODE=atlas` + UI local (future: UI deployed)
