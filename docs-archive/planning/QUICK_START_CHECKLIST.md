# Quick Start Checklist - Week 1 Action Items

## üöÄ Immediate Actions (This Week)

### Day 1-2: Assessment & Documentation
- [ ] **Audit PowerShell Scripts**
  ```powershell
  # Run this to get a complete inventory
  Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -Filter "*.ps1" | 
  Select-Object FullName, Length, LastWriteTime |
  Export-Csv "powershell_script_inventory.csv"
  ```

- [ ] **Create Environment Template**
  ```bash
  # Copy from existing test env and expand
  cp app/tests/.env .env.example
  ```

- [ ] **Document Current Workflows**
  - [ ] How do you currently deploy to production?
  - [ ] How do you switch between local/atlas modes?
  - [ ] What's the current testing process?

### Day 3-4: Safety First
- [ ] **Create Backup Strategy**
  ```bash
  # Create a backup of current working scripts
  mkdir -p backup/powershell-scripts-$(date +%Y%m%d)
  cp -r scripts/ backup/powershell-scripts-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
  ```

- [ ] **Test Current State**
  - [ ] Verify all three deployment modes work currently
  - [ ] Document any existing issues or pain points
  - [ ] Run existing tests: `cd app/tests && npm test`

### Day 5: Foundation Setup
- [ ] **Create Basic GitHub Actions**
  - [ ] Start with simple CI pipeline (testing only)
  - [ ] No deployments yet - just validation

- [ ] **Enhance Testing**
  - [ ] Add tests for environment configuration validation
  - [ ] Add health check tests for each deployment mode

## üìã Phase 1 Detailed Tasks (Weeks 1-3)

### Week 1: Documentation & Analysis
#### Monday-Tuesday: Script Audit
- [ ] Categorize all 76 PowerShell scripts by function:
  - [ ] Deployment scripts (Lambda, containers, etc.)
  - [ ] Database management scripts  
  - [ ] Testing scripts
  - [ ] Utility/helper scripts
  - [ ] AWS/Infrastructure scripts
- [ ] Identify critical vs. nice-to-have scripts
- [ ] Document script dependencies and execution order

#### Wednesday-Thursday: Current State Documentation  
- [ ] Create architecture diagram of current deployment process
- [ ] Document all environment variables used across the project
- [ ] Map out the three deployment modes in detail
- [ ] Document pain points and improvement opportunities

#### Friday: Safety Measures
- [ ] Create comprehensive backup of current working state
- [ ] Set up rollback procedures for each type of change
- [ ] Create "known good state" snapshot

### Week 2: Testing Infrastructure
#### Monday-Tuesday: Test Suite Enhancement
- [ ] Extend `app/tests/` to cover configuration validation
- [ ] Add integration tests for MongoDB mode switching
- [ ] Create deployment validation tests
- [ ] Add performance baseline tests

#### Wednesday-Thursday: Environment Standardization
- [ ] Create comprehensive `.env.example` with all variables
- [ ] Create mode-specific environment templates:
  - [ ] `.env.local.template` - Fully local mode
  - [ ] `.env.remote-db.template` - Remote DB mode  
  - [ ] `.env.lambda.template` - For local Lambda testing
- [ ] Add environment validation script

#### Friday: Docker Enhancement
- [ ] Review current docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Plan mode-specific compose files
- [ ] Enhance health checks in containers
- [ ] Add development vs production configurations

### Week 3: Basic GitHub Actions
#### Monday-Tuesday: CI Pipeline Setup
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for basic testing
- [ ] Add automated testing on pull requests
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules

#### Wednesday-Thursday: Testing Automation
- [ ] Automate testing for all three deployment modes
- [ ] Add container security scanning
- [ ] Add dependency vulnerability scanning

#### Friday: Validation & Review
- [ ] Test all new automation with existing PowerShell scripts
- [ ] Validate that nothing is broken
- [ ] Review and adjust plan based on findings

## üéØ Success Criteria for Phase 1

By end of Week 3, you should have:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Complete documentation of current state
- [ ] ‚úÖ Enhanced test suite covering all deployment modes  
- [ ] ‚úÖ Basic GitHub Actions CI pipeline running
- [ ] ‚úÖ Standardized environment configuration
- [ ] ‚úÖ Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] ‚úÖ Zero production disruption from changes made

## üö® Red Flags to Watch For

Stop and reassess if you encounter:
- [ ] ‚ùå Any production deployments failing
- [ ] ‚ùå Existing scripts breaking unexpectedly  
- [ ] ‚ùå Database connection issues in any mode
- [ ] ‚ùå Test coverage dropping below current levels
- [ ] ‚ùå Developer workflow becoming more complex

## üìû Decision Points

At the end of Phase 1, evaluate:
1. **Complexity Assessment**: Is the current PowerShell approach more/less complex than anticipated?
2. **Risk Assessment**: What risks have we identified that weren't obvious initially?
3. **Timeline Adjustment**: Do we need to adjust the timeline based on findings?
4. **Priority Adjustment**: Should we focus on different scripts first based on usage patterns?

## üîÑ Next Phase Preview

Phase 2 will focus on:
- Replacing deployment scripts with GitHub Actions
- Adding npm scripts for common developer tasks
- Creating containerized alternatives to PowerShell utilities
- Implementing Taskfile.yml for cross-platform task automation

**Remember: The goal is gradual, safe improvement - not a complete rewrite overnight!**
