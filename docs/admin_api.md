# Admin API Documentation

## Overview

The MomsRecipeBox Admin API provides user management functionality with role-based access control. All admin endpoints require authentication with admin privileges.

## Authentication

Admin endpoints require a valid JWT token with admin role. The token must be included in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

### Token Types Accepted:
1. **Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Token**: Automatically grants admin access
2. **User Token with Admin Role**: User must have `admin` role in `https://momsrecipebox.app/roles` claim

## Admin Endpoints

### 1. List Users with Statistics

**GET** `/admin/users`

Lists all users with their Auth0 profile data and app usage statistics.

**Response:**
```json

    }
  ],

}
```

### 2. Invite User

}
```

**Response:**

{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User newuser@example.com invited successfully",
  "user": {
    "user_id": "auth0|60f7f2c8b1d2e3000000001",
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "emailVerified": false
  }
}
```

### 3. Delete User

**DELETE** `/admin/users/{userId}`

**Parameters:**
- `userId` (path): The Auth0 user ID (URL encoded)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User deleted successfully",
  "deletedUserId": "auth0|60f7f2c8b1d2e3000000001"
}
```

## Error Responses

All admin endpoints return consistent error responses:

### Authentication Errors (401)
```json
{
  "error": "Authentication failed",
  "details": "Invalid token",
  "code": "AUTH_FAILED"
}
```

### Authorization Errors (403)
```json
{
  "error": "Insufficient permissions",
  "required": ["list_users"],
  "userRole": "user",
  "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS"
}
```

### Server Errors (500)
```json
{
  "error": "Internal server error",
  "details": "Database connection failed",
  "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR"
}
```

## Permission System

The admin system uses a role-based permission model:

### Roles:
- **user**: Regular application users
- **admin**: Can manage users and moderate content
- **super_admin**: Full system access (future use)

### Admin Permissions:
- `list_users`: View user list and statistics
- `view_user_details`: View individual user details
- `invite_users`: Invite new users to the platform
- `delete_users`: Delete users and their data
- `delete_any_recipe`: Delete any recipe (not just own)
- `moderate_comments`: Moderate user comments
- `view_all_recipes`: View all recipes regardless of visibility
- `view_analytics`: View system analytics

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Auth0 Configuration

Create a Machine-to-Machine application in Auth0:

1. Go to Auth0 Dashboard â†’ Applications
2. Create a "Machine to Machine Application"
3. Authorize for the Management API
4. Grant scopes: `read:users`, `create:users`, `delete:users`, `read:user_app_metadata`

### 2. Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Auth0 M2M Configuration
AUTH0_M2M_CLIENT_ID=your_m2m_client_id
AUTH0_M2M_CLIENT_SECRET=your_m2m_client_secret
```

### 3. User Role Assignment

To grant admin privileges to a user, add a custom claim to their token:

```json
{
  "https://momsrecipebox.app/roles": ["admin"]
}
```

This can be done through Auth0 Actions or Rules.

## Testing

Use the included test script to verify functionality:

```bash
cd app
node test_admin_functions.js
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Token Validation**: All tokens are validated against Auth0's JWKS endpoint
2. **Role Verification**: Admin roles are verified through custom claims or M2M grants
3. **Audit Logging**: All admin actions are logged with user identification
4. **Self-Protection**: Users cannot delete their own accounts through the API
5. **Rate Limiting**: M2M tokens are cached for 24 hours to prevent rate limiting
6. **Data Cleanup**: User deletion removes all associated data from MongoDB

## Rate Limits

- Auth0 Management API calls are rate limited
- M2M tokens are cached for 24 hours to minimize API calls
- Consider implementing additional rate limiting for admin endpoints in production
