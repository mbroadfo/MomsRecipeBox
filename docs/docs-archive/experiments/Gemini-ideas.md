Here are my suggestions for improvements, focusing on the AI Services and Infrastructure sections:1. AI Services Cost and Token MetricsYour idea to include cost is excellent. The most important metrics for managing AI API costs and performance are:Cost Metrics:Cost Per 1,000 Tokens (Input & Output): This is the fundamental pricing metric. You could show a static value (e.g., $0.01/$0.03) next to the latency.Total Daily/Weekly Spend: A running total for each provider, especially the Slowest or those with high usage, would be key for budget monitoring.Token Metrics:Total Tokens Used (Input/Output): A counter to track overall usage, which directly relates to cost.Requests Per Minute (RPM): To monitor your application's rate limiting against the provider's limits.Visual Improvement: Turn the latency (e.g., 466ms) into a small, simple sparkline graph that shows Latency Trend over the last hour.2. Infrastructure Metrics for a Serverless ArchitectureFor an application using MongoDB Atlas, Lambda (Docker), and CloudFront (React), the current metrics are good, but you can refine and add more critical ones:Current MetricRecommended Improvement/AdditionRationaleMongoDB DatabaseActive Connections / Connection Pool Size: Check for pool exhaustion. Query Latency (P95): The speed of the 95th percentile slowest query. Storage Usage: Ensure you don't hit Atlas limits.Health of the database is paramount for performance.S3 Image BucketTotal Objects / Storage Size: Essential for cost tracking. Transfer Out (Egress) Data: Direct cost driver for S3/CloudFront.Directly relates to costs and scaling.API GatewayLatency (P99): Focus on the worst-case response time. 5xx/4xx Error Count: Monitor server and client errors. Throttling Count: Check for API Gateway limits being hit.A high P99 latency is often what users experience as a "slow app."Lambda FunctionsInvocation Count: The primary cost metric for Lambda. Duration (P95/Max): Ensure functions are running efficiently (especially for Docker images). Concurrent Executions: Monitor against account limits.Lambda cost and performance are driven by invocations and duration.Backup SystemLast Successful Backup Time: A timestamp is more assuring than a count of folders.Confirms operational status.Performance & CDNCloudFront Cache Hit Ratio: The single most important metric for CDN efficiency and cost saving. Global User Latency: Monitor real user performance (via RUM data, if available).High cache hit ratio means fast performance and low origin server load.Security & SSLAuth0 Status: You should aim to make the incomplete setup a success status, perhaps showing Token Refresh Status or Active User Sessions.Confirms the main identity provider is working correctly.In summary, you should monitor these things:Cost Drivers: Lambda Invocations, S3/CloudFront Transfer Out, AI Token Usage.User Experience: API Gateway P99 Latency, CloudFront Cache Hit Ratio, Query Latency.System Health: Database Connection Pool, Lambda Errors/Throttling, Last Backup Time.
