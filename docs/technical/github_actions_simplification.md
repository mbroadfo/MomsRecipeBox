# GitHub Actions Workflow Simplification

**Date**: September 26, 2025  
**Type**: DevOps Configuration Update

## Summary

Simplified GitHub Actions workflow to align with manual deployment approach and removed automatic deployment to provide full developer control over deployments.

## Changes Made

### GitHub Actions Workflows

- ✅ **Simplified `ci.yml`**: Removed complex deployment testing, kept essential code quality validation
- ✅ **Updated Node.js version**: 18 → 20 (fixes markdownlint compatibility)
- ✅ **Removed `deploy.yaml`**: Eliminated automatic deployment on push to master
- ✅ **Focused scope**: GitHub Actions now validates code quality only

### Documentation Updates

- ✅ **README.md**: Added GitHub Actions section explaining validation-only approach
- ✅ **NPM_COMMANDS.md**: Added note about manual deployment via npm scripts
- ✅ **QUICK_START_GUIDE.md**: Added note about GitHub Actions validation
- ✅ **Technical docs**: Added workflow simplification summary

### Workflow Now

1. **Code commits** → GitHub Actions validates quality (tests, security, Docker config)
2. **Manual deployment** → Developer controls when/what to deploy via npm scripts:
   - `npm run deploy:lambda` - Deploy backend
   - `npm run deploy:ui` - Deploy UI
   - `npm run deploy:full:dev` - Deploy both

## Benefits

### ✅ Developer Control

- No unwanted deployments on commit
- Deploy only when ready
- Full control over deployment timing

### ✅ Simplified CI/CD

- Fast validation (no deployment overhead)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced GitHub Actions complexity

### ✅ Better Developer Experience

- Commit without deployment fear
- Flexible deployment via npm scripts
- Maintains comprehensive automation

## Technical Details

### GitHub Actions Validation

```yaml
- Unit tests (npm test)
- Security audit (npm audit --audit-level=high)  
- Docker configuration validation
- Node.js 20 compatibility
```

### Manual Deployment Commands

```bash
npm run deploy:lambda     # Deploy Lambda function
npm run deploy:ui         # Deploy UI to CloudFront
npm run deploy:full:dev   # Deploy both (dev environment)
```

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Simplified workflow
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml` - Deleted (was automatic deployment)
- `README.md` - Added GitHub Actions section
- `NPM_COMMANDS.md` - Added deployment control note
- `QUICK_START_GUIDE.md` - Added validation note
- `docs/technical/markdown_linting_cleanup.md` - Added workflow changes

---

**Result**: Clean, focused GitHub Actions workflow that validates code quality while preserving full manual deployment control via npm scripts.
