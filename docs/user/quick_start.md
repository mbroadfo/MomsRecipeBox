# Quick Start Guide

Get Mom's Recipe Box running in under 5 minutes using the new four-profile deployment system.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Docker Desktop** - [Download here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- **AWS CLI** (optional) - For cloud features

## 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbroadfo/MomsRecipeBox.git
cd MomsRecipeBox
npm install
```

## 2. Setup Environment

```bash
npm run setup:local
```

This creates your `.env` file with local development settings.

## 3. Choose Your Profile

The application supports four deployment profiles:

### üè† Local Profile (Recommended for First Run)
```bash
npm run profile:local    # Switch to local profile
npm run profile:start    # Start local infrastructure
```

### üåç Atlas Profile (For Cloud Database)
```bash
npm run profile:atlas    # Switch to atlas profile  
npm run profile:start    # Start backend with Atlas DB
```

### ‚ö° Lambda Profile (For Testing Production API)
```bash
npm run profile:lambda   # Switch to lambda profile
# Connects directly to deployed Lambda - no local backend needed
```

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Profile (Full Production)
```bash
npm run profile:cloud    # Switch to cloud profile
# All services are cloud-deployed
```

## 4. Check Your Profile Status

```bash
npm run profile:show     # Shows current profile and configuration
```

## 5. Start the UI (Optional)

```bash
cd ui && npm run dev     # Start React development server
```

The UI automatically connects to the correct backend based on your current profile.

## 6. Verify Everything Works

```bash
npm run health:detailed  # Check API health
```

Should show all services running and healthy.

## 7. Add Test Data or Restore Backup

### Option A: Add Test Data
```bash
npm run test:data
```

### Option B: Restore from Backup (if available)
```bash
# Restore from S3 backup
npm run restore:from-s3

# Or restore latest backup
npm run restore:latest
```

This will populate your database with either test recipes or your backed-up family recipes.
