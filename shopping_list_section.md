# ðŸ›’ Interactive Ingredients & Shopping List

New ingredient functionality enhances the recipe detail view:

- **Checkboxes**: Replaced bullet points with interactive checkboxes for each ingredient
- **State Persistence**: Checked ingredient states are saved to localStorage and persist across page refreshes
- **Professional Button Bar**: Four-button control panel for ingredient management:
  - **Select All**: Quickly check all ingredients in the recipe
  - **Clear All**: Uncheck all ingredients at once
  - **Add Selected to Shopping List**: Add checked ingredients to shopping list
  - **Go to Shopping List**: Navigate to shopping list page
- **Visual Feedback**: Checked ingredients show with strike-through text and animated checkmarks
- **Responsive Design**: Button bar adapts to all screen sizes with horizontal scrolling on mobile

The backend shopping list functionality includes:

- **Per-user Storage**: Shopping lists are stored per user with MongoDB
- **Recipe Context**: Each item maintains a link to its source recipe
- **Item Status**: Track whether items have been checked off
- **Bulk Operations**: Add multiple items at once, mark all as checked, or clear entire list
- **Complete API**: Full set of endpoints for managing shopping lists
- **Field Naming Compatibility**: Support for both legacy and new field naming conventions (`ingredient`/`name`, `recipe_id`/`recipeId`) ensuring backward compatibility

This feature creates a more interactive cooking experience with shopping list functionality that syncs across devices.
